## Problem Statement

In a stock market, there is a product with its infinite stocks. The stock prices are given for <b>N</b> days, where <b>price[i]</b> denotes the price of the stock on the i<sup>th</sup> day.<br>There is a rule that a customer can buy at most i stock on the i<sup>th</sup> day.<br>If the customer has an amount of <b>k</b> amount of money initially. The task is to find out the maximum number of stocks a customer can buy. 

<b>Examples:</b>

<pre><b>Input</b><b>: </b>price[]= [10,7,19], k= 45<br><b>Output</b><b>: </b>4 <br><b>Explanation : </b>A customer purchases 1 stock on day 1, 2 stocks on day 2 and 1 stock on day 3 for 10, 7 * 2 = 14 and 19 respectively. Hence, total amount is 10 + 14 + 19 = 43 and number of stocks purchased is 4.</pre>

<pre><b><br></b><b>Input</b><b>: </b>price[ ]<b>= </b>[7,10, 4], k=100<br><b>Output</b><b>: </b>6<br><b><b>Explanation</b></b>: Buy all three days </pre>

<b><br></b><b>Constraints:</b><br>1 <= N <= 10<sup>4</sup><br>1 <= price[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup><br>1 <= k <= 10<sup>4</sup><br>

## Expected Complexities
- Time Complexity: O(n log n)
- Auxiliary Space: O(n)
