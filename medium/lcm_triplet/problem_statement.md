## Problem Statement

Given a number <b>n, </b>find the maximum possible LCM that can be obtained by selecting three numbers less than or equal to n.<br><b>Note</b> : LCM stands for Lowest Common Multiple.

<b>Examples:</b>

<pre><b>Input:</b> n = 9
<b>Output: </b>504
<b>Explanation: </b>504 is the maximum LCM that can be attained by any triplet of numbers less than or equal 9. The triplet which has this LCM is {7, 8, 9}.</pre>

<pre><b>Input:</b> n = 7
<b>Output: </b>210
<b>Explanation: </b>210 is the maximum LCM that can be attained by any triplet of numbers less than or equal 7. The triplet which has this LCM is {5, 6, 7}.<br></pre>

<b>Constraints:</b><br>1 ≤ n ≤ 10<sup>3</sup>

## Expected Complexities
- Time Complexity: O(1)
- Auxiliary Space: O(1)
