## Problem Statement

Given a mathematical equation that contains only numbers and +, -, *, /. Print the equation in reverse, such that the equation is reversed, but the numbers remain the same.<br>It is guaranteed that the given equation is valid, and there are no leading zeros.

<b>Example 1:</b>

<pre><b>Input:</b>
S = "20-3+5*2"
<b>Output:</b> 2*5+3-20
<b>Explanation</b>: The equation is reversed with
numbers remaining the same.
</pre>

<b>Example 2:</b>

<pre><b>Input</b>: 
S = "5+2*56-2/4"
<b>Output:</b> 4/2-56*2+5
<b>Explanation</b>: The equation is reversed with
numbers remaining the same.
</pre>

<b>Your Task:</b><br>You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function <b>reverseEqn() </b>which takes the string S representing the equation as input and returns the resultant string representing the equation in reverse.

<b>Expected Time Complexity: </b>O(|S|).<br><b>Expected Auxiliary Space: </b>O(|S|).

<b>Constraints:</b><br>1<=|S|<=10<sup>5</sup><br>The string contains only the characters '0' - '9', '+', '-', '*', and '/'.
