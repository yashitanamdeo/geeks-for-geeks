## Problem Statement

Ishaan has been given a task by his teacher. He needs to find the Nth term of a series. His teacher gives him some examples to help him out (Refer examples below). He is a bit weak in pattern searching so to help him his teacher told him that the Nth term is <b>related to prime numbers</b>. The Nth term is the <b>difference of N and the closest prime number to N</b>. Help him find the Nth term for a given N.<br> 

<b>Example 1:</b>

<pre><b>Input:</b> N = 10
<b>Output: </b>1
<b>Explanation: </b>Closest prime to 10 is 11.
</pre>

<b>Example 2:</b>

<pre><b>Input: </b>N = 7
<b>Output: </b>0
<b>Explanation: </b>Closest prime to 7 is 7.
</pre>

 

<b>Your Task:</b><br>You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function <b>NthTerm() </b>which takes N as input paramater and returns Nth term.<br> 

<b>Expected Time Complexity: </b>O(N* <b>√ </b>N)<br><b>Expected Space Complexity: </b>O(1)

<b>Constraints:</b><br>1 <= N <= 100000
