## Problem Statement

Given a number <b>n,</b> check if the number is <b>perfect</b> or not. A number is said to be perfect if <b>sum</b> of all its factors excluding the number itself is equal to the <b>number</b>.

<b>Examples:</b>

<pre><b>Input: </b>n<b> </b>=<b> </b>6
<b>Output: </b>true 
<b>Explanation: </b>Factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3 and 6. Excluding 6 their sum is 6 which is equal to n itself. So, it's a Perfect Number.</pre>

<pre><b>Input:</b> n<b> </b>=<b> </b>10
<b>Output: </b>false<br><b>Explanation: </b>Factors of 10 are 1, 2, 5 and 10. Excluding 10 their sum is 8 which is not equal to n itself. So, it's not a Perfect Number.<br></pre>

<pre><b>Input:</b> n<b> </b>=<b> </b>15
<b>Output: </b>false<br><b>Explanation: </b>Factors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, 15. Excluding 15 their sum is 9 which is not equal to n itself. So, it's not a Perfect Number.</pre>

<b>Constraints:</b><br>1 ≤ n ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>

## Expected Complexities
- Time Complexity: O(sqrt(n))
- Auxiliary Space: O(1)
