## Problem Statement

You have given two <b>sorted</b> arrays <b>arr1[]</b> & <b>arr2[]</b> of <b>distinct</b> elements. The first array has one element extra added in between. Return the <b>index</b> of the extra element.

<b>Note</b>: 0-based indexing is followed.

<b>Examples</b>

<pre><b>Input: </b>a[] = [2,4,6,8,9,10,12], b[] = [2,4,6,8,10,12]
<b>Output: </b>4<b>
Explanation: </b>In the first array, 9 is extra added and it's index is 4.</pre>

<pre><b>Input: </b>a[] = [3,5,7,8,11,13], b[] = [3,5,7,11,13]
<b>Output: </b>3<br><b>Explanation: </b>In the first array, 8 is extra and it's index is 3.</pre>

<pre><b>Input: </b>a[] = [3,5], b[] = [3]
<b>Output: </b>1<br><b>Explanation: </b>In the first array, 5 is extra and it's index is 1.</pre>

<b>Constraints:</b><br>2<=arr1.size()<=10<sup>5</sup><br>1<=arr1[i],arr2[i]<=10<sup>6</sup>

## Expected Complexities
- Time Complexity: O(log n)
- Auxiliary Space: O(1)
