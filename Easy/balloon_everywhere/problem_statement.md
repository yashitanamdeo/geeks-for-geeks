## Problem Statement

Bob is very fond of balloons. Once he visited an amusement park with his mother. The mother told Bob that she would buy him a balloon only if he answer her problem right. She gave Bob a string<b> S </b>[contains only lowercase characters] and asked him to use the characters of string to form as many instances of the word "balloon" as possible. Return the <b>maximum</b> number of instances that can be formed.

Help Bob to solve the problem.

<b>Note:</b> You can use each character in the string <b>at most once</b>. 

<b>Example 1:</b>

<pre><b>Input:
</b>S: nlaebolko
<b>Output: </b>1
<b>Explanation:</b>
Here, the number of occurence of 'b' = 1
of occurence of 'a' = 1
of occurence of 'l' = 2
of occurence of 'o' = 2
of occurence of 'n' = 1
So, we can form 1 "balloon" using the letters.
 
</pre>

<b>Example 2: </b>

<pre><b>Input:
</b>S: loonbalxballpoon
<b>Output: </b>2
<b>Explanation:</b>
Here, the number of occurence of 'b' = 2
of occurence of 'a' = 2
of occurence of 'l' = 4
of occurence of 'o' = 4
of occurence of 'n' = 2
So, we can form 2 "balloon" using the letters.
</pre>

 

<b>Your Task:</b><br>The task is to complete the function <b>maxInstance</b>() which takes a string as the only input parameter and should return the <b>maximum</b> instances that can be formed of the word "<b>balloon</b>" using the given string.

<b>Expected Time Complexity:</b> O(n), n is size of the given string.<br><b>Expected Auxiliary Space:</b> O(26).

<b>Constraints:</b><br>1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>6</sup>
