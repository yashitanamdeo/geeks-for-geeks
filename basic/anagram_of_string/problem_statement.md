## Problem Statement

Given two strings<b> s1 </b>and <b>s2</b> in lowercase, the task is to make them anagrams. The only allowed operation is to remove a character from any string. Find the <b>minimum number</b> of characters to be deleted to make both the strings anagram. Two strings are called anagrams of each other if one of them can be converted into another by rearranging its letters.

<b>Examples:</b>

<pre><b>Input: </b>s1 = "bcadeh", s2 = "hea"
<b>Output: </b>3<b>
Explanation: </b>We need to remove b, c and d from s1.
</pre>

<pre><b>Input: </b>s1 = "cddgk", s2 = "gcd"
<b>Output: </b>2<b>
Explanation: </b>We need to remove d and k from s1.</pre>

<b>Constraints:</b><br>1 <= |s1|, |s2| <= 10<sup>5</sup>

## Expected Complexities
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Auxiliary Space: O(1)
