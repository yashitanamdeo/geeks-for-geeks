## Problem Statement

Given a pair of strings <b>s1</b> and <b>s2</b> of equal lengths, your task is to find which of the two strings has more <b>distinct subsequences</b>. If both strings have the same number of distinct subsequences, return <b>s1</b>.

<b>Examples:</b>

<pre><b>Input: </b>s1 = "gfg", s2 = "ggg"
<b>Output:</b> "gfg"
<b>Explanation: "</b>gfg" have 6 distinct subsequences whereas "ggg" have 3 distinct subsequences. 
</pre>

<pre><b>Input:</b> s1 = "a", s2 = "b"
<b>Output:</b> "a"
<b>Explanation: </b>Both the strings have only 1 distinct subsequence.</pre>

<b>Constraints:</b><br>1 <= n <= 30

## Expected Complexities
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Auxiliary Space: O(1)
