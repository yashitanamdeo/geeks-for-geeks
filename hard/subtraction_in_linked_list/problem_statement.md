## Problem Statement

You are given two <b>linked lists</b> representing two <b>large positive numbers</b>. The linked lists represent these two numbers, <b>subtract </b>the smaller number from the larger one and return the head of the linked list<b> </b>representing the result. Please take a look at the examples to get a better understanding of the task.<br>

The linked list does not contain leading zeros, except for the number zero itself.

<b>Examples:</b>

<pre><b>Input: </b>LinkedList1: 1->0->0, LinkedList2: 1->2<br><b>Output:  </b>LinkedList: 8->8<br><b>Explanation: </b>First linked list represents 100 and the second one represents 12. 12 subtracted from 100 gives us 88 as the result. It is represented as 8->8 in the linked list.<br><br></pre>

<pre><b>Input: </b>LinkedList1: 6->3, LinkedList2: 7->1->0<br><b>Output: </b>LinkedList: 6->4->7<br><b>Explanation: </b>First linked list represents 63 and the second one represents 710. 63 subtracted from 710 gives us 647 as the result. It is represented as 6->4->7 in the linked list.<br><br></pre>

<b>Constraints:</b><br>1 <= size of both linked lists <= 10<sup>6</sup><br>0 <= node->data <= 9<sup><br></sup>

## Expected Complexities
- Time Complexity: O(n + m)
- Auxiliary Space: O(n + m)
