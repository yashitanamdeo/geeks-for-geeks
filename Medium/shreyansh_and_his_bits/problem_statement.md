## Problem Statement

Shreyansh has an integer N. He is really curious about the binary representation of integers. He sees that any given integer has a number of set bits. Now he wants to find out that how many positive integers, strictly less than N, have the <b>same number of set bits as N</b>.<br>
He is a little weak in maths. Help him find the number of integers.<br>
<b>Note</b> : Since N takes large values, brute force won't work.

 

<b>Example 1:</b>

<pre><b>Input</b>:
N = 8
<b>Output:</b> 3
<b>Explanation</b>:
Binary representation of 8 : 1000
So the integers less than 8 with 
same number of set bits are : 4, 2, 1
Hence, the result is 3.  
</pre>

 

<b>Example 2:</b>

<pre><b>Input:</b>
N = 4
<b>Output: </b>2
Explanation:
Binary representation of 4 : 100
So the integers less than 4 with 
same number of set bits are : 2, 1
So, The result is 2.
</pre>

<br>
<b>Your Task:  </b><br>
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function <b>count()</b> which takes the integer N<b> </b>as input parameters and returns the required answer.<br>
<br>
<b>Expected Time Complexity:</b> O(log(n))<br>
<b>Expected Auxiliary Space:</b> O(log(n)*log(n))<br>
 

 

<b>Constraints :</b> <br>
1 <= N <= 10^12
