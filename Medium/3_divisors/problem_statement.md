## Problem Statement

You are given a list of <b>q</b> queries, and for each query, an integer <b>n</b> is provided. The task is to find how many numbers less than or equal to <b>n</b> have exactly <b>3 divisors</b>.

<b>Examples:</b>

<pre><b>Input: </b>q = 1<br>          query[0] = 6
<b>Output: </b>1
<b>Explanation: </b>There is only one number 4 which has exactly three divisors 1, 2 and 4 and less than equal to 6.</pre>

<pre><b>Input: </b>q = 2
       query[0] = 6
       query[1] = 10
<b>Output: </b>1
        2
<b>Explanation: </b>For query 1 it is covered in the example 1. query 2:There are two numbers 4 and 9 having exactly 3 divisors and less than <br>equal to 10.</pre>

<b>Constraints :Â </b><br>1 <= q <= 10<sup>3</sup><br>1 <= query[i] <= 10<sup>12</sup>

## Expected Complexities
- Time Complexity: O(q*n*log(log(n)))
- Auxiliary Space: O(n)
