## Problem Statement

Given an array <b>arr[] </b>of non-negative integers, where each element arr[i] represents the height of the <b>vertical lines, </b>find the <b>maximum amount of water</b> that can be contained between any two lines, together with the x-axis.

Note: In the case of a single vertical line it will not be able to hold water.

<b>Examples:</b>

<pre><b>Input: </b>arr[] = [1, 5, 4, 3]
<b>Output: </b>6<b>
Explanation: </b>5 and 3 are 2 distance apart. So the size of the base is 2. Height of container = min(5, 3) = 3. So, total area to hold water = 3 * 2 = 6.</pre>

<pre><b>Input: </b>arr[] = [3, 1, 2, 4, 5]
<b>Output: </b>12<b>
Explanation: </b>5 and 3 are 4 distance apart. So the size of the base is 4. Height of container = min(5, 3) = 3. So, total area to hold water = 4 * 3 = 12.</pre>

<pre><b>Input</b>: arr[] = [2, 1, 8, 6, 4, 6, 5, 5]<br><b>Output</b>: 25 <br><b>Explanation</b>: 8 and 5 are 5 distance apart. So the size of the base is 5. Height of container = min(8, 5) = 5. So, the total area to hold water = 5 * 5 = 25.</pre>

<b>Constraints:</b><br>1<= arr.size() <=10<sup>5</sup><br>1<= arr[i] <=10<sup>4</sup>

## Expected Complexities
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Auxiliary Space: O(1)
