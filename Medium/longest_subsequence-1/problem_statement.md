## Problem Statement

Given an integer array <b>arr[]</b>, find the length of the longest subsequence such that the absolute difference between adjacent elements is 1.

<b>Examples:</b>

<pre><b>Input: </b>arr[] = [10, 9, 4, 5, 4, 8, 6]
<b>Output:</b> 3
<b>Explanation:</b> The three possible subsequences of length 3 are {10, 9, 8}, {4, 5, 4}, and {4, 5, 6}, where adjacent elements have a absolute difference of 1. No valid subsequence of greater length could be formed.</pre>

<pre><b>Input:</b> arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
<b>Output:</b> 5
<b>Explanation:</b> All the elements can be included in the valid subsequence.</pre>

<b>Constraints:</b><br>1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10<sup>3</sup><br>1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10<sup>3</sup>

## Expected Complexities
- Time Complexity: O(n^2)
- Auxiliary Space: O(n)
