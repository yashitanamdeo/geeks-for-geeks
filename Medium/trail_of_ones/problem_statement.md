## Problem Statement

Given an integer <b>n</b>, the task is to <b>count</b> the number of <b>binary strings</b> of length <b>n</b> that contains at least one pair of <b>consecutive 1's</b>.<br><b>Note:</b> A binary string is a sequence made up of only<b> 0's</b> and <b>1's</b>.

<b>Examples:</b>

<pre><b>Input:</b> n = 2
<b>Output:</b> 1
<b>Explanation:</b> There are 4 strings of length 2, the strings are 00, 01, 10, and 11. Only the string 11 has consecutive 1's.</pre>

<pre><b>Input:</b> n = 3
<b>Output:</b> 3
<b>Explanation:</b> There are 8 strings of length 3, the strings are 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110 and 111. The strings with consecutive 1's are 011, 110 and 111.</pre>

<pre><b>Input: </b>n = 5
<b>Output: </b>19
<b>Explanation: </b>There are 19 strings having at least one pair of consecutive 1's.
</pre>

<b>Constraints:</b><br>2 ≤ n<b> </b>≤ 30

## Expected Complexities
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Auxiliary Space: O(1)
