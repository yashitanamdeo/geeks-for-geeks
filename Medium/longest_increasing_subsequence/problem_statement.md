## Problem Statement

Given an array <b>arr[]</b> of non-negative integers, the task is to find the <b>length</b> of the <b>Longest Strictly Increasing Subsequence (LIS)</b>.

A subsequence is <b>strictly increasing</b> if each element in the subsequence is strictly less than the next element.

<b>Examples:</b>

<pre><b>Input: </b>arr[] = [5, 8, 3, 7, 9, 1]
<b>Output: </b>3<b>
Explanation: </b>The longest strictly increasing subsequence could be [5, 7, 9], which has a length of 3.</pre>

<pre><b>Input: </b>arr[] = [0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 7, 15]
<b>Output: </b>6<b>
Explanation: </b>One of the possible longest strictly increasing subsequences is [0, 2, 6, 9, 13, 15], which has a length of 6.</pre>

<pre><b>Input: </b>arr[] = [3, 10, 2, 1, 20]
<b>Output: </b>3<b>
Explanation: </b>The longest strictly increasing subsequence could be [3, 10, 20], which has a length of 3.</pre>

<b>Constraints:</b><br>1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10<sup>3</sup><br>0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10<sup>6</sup>

## Expected Complexities
- Time Complexity: O(n log n)
- Auxiliary Space: O(n)
