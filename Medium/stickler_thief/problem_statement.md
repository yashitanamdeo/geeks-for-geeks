## Problem Statement

Stickler the thief wants to loot money from the houses arranged in a line. He cannot loot <b>two consecutive </b>houses and aims to <b>maximize</b> his total loot. <br>Given an array, <b>arr[]</b> where arr[i] represents the amount of money in the i-th house.<br>Determine the <b>maximum</b> amount he can loot.

<b>Examples:</b>

<pre><b>Input: </b>arr[] = [6, 5, 5, 7, 4]
<b>Output: </b>15
<b>Explanation: </b>Maximum amount he can get by looting 1st, 3rd and 5th house. Which is 6 + 5 + 4 = 15.</pre>

<pre><b>Input: </b>arr[] = [1, 5, 3]
<b>Output: </b>5
<b>Explanation: </b>Loot only 2nd house and get maximum amount of 5.<br></pre>

<pre><b>Input: </b>arr[] = [4, 4, 4, 4]
<b>Output: </b>8
<b>Explanation: </b>The optimal choice is to loot every alternate house. Looting the 1st and 3rd houses, or the 2nd and 4th, both give a maximum total of 4 + 4 = 8.</pre>

<b>Constraints:</b><br>1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10<sup>5</sup><br>1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10<sup>4</sup>

## Expected Complexities
