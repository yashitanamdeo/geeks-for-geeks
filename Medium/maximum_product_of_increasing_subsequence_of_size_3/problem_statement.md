## Problem Statement

Given a sequence of non-negative integers, find the subsequence of length 3 having maximum product, with the elements of the subsequence being in increasing order.

 

<b>Example 1:</b>

<pre><b>â€‹Input:</b>
n = 8
arr[ ] = {6, 7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 9, 10}
<b>Output:
</b>8 9 10
<b>Explanation: </b>3 increasing elements of 
the given arrays are 8,9 and 10 which 
forms the subsequence of size 3 with 
maximum product.
</pre>

<br>
<b>â€‹Example 2:</b>

<pre><b>Input:
</b>n = 4
arr[ ] = {3, 4, 2, 1} <b>
Output:
</b>Not Present </pre>

 

<b>Your Task:</b><br>
This is a function problem. The input is already taken care of by the driver code. You only need to complete the function <b>maxProductSubsequence()</b> that takes an array <b>arr</b>, sizeOfArray <b>n</b>, and return the subsequence of size 3 having the maximum product, numbers of subsequence being in increasing order. If no such sequence exists, return <b>"-1"</b>. The driver code takes care of the printing.

<br>
<b>Expected Time Complexity:</b> O(N*LOG(N)).<br>
<b>Expected Auxiliary Space:</b> O(N).

<br>
<br>
<b>Constraints:</b><br>
1 <= <b>N</b> <= 10<sup>5</sup><br>
1 <= <b>Arr[i]</b> <= 10<sup>5</sup>
