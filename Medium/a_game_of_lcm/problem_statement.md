## Problem Statement

Given an integer N. Find maximum LCM (Least Common Multiple) that can be obtained from four numbers less than or equal to N.<br>
Note: Duplicate numbers can be used.

<b>Example 1:</b>

<pre><b>Input:</b>
N = 4
<b>Output: </b>12
<b>Explanation:</b>
The four numbers can be [4,4,3,2] or
[4,4,4,3], etc. It can be shown that 12 is
the maximum LCM of four numbers that can
be obtained from numbers less than or equal 
to 4.</pre>

<b>Example 2:</b>

<pre><b>Input:</b>
N = 5
<b>Output: </b>60
<b>Explanation:</b>
The four numbers can be [5,5,4,3] or
[5,4,3,2], etc. 60 is the maximum that can
be obtained.</pre>

<b>Your Task:</b><br>
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function <b>maxGcd()</b> which takes N as the input parameter and returns the maximum LCM that can be obtained from four numbers less than or equal to N.

<b>Expected Time Complexity: </b>O( N<sup>4</sup> )<br>
<b>Expected Auxillary Space: </b>O(1)

<b>Constraints:</b><br>
4 ≤ N ≤ 50
