## Problem Statement

Given a positive number n. You need to write a program to find the maximum sum of distinct numbers such that the LCM of all these numbers is equal to n and those numbers are less than or equal to n.<br>
<br>
<b>Example 1:</b>

<pre><b>Input</b>: n = 2
<b>Output:</b> 3 
<b>Explanation</b>: The distinct numbers you can have are 
just 1 and 2 and their sum is equal to 3.</pre>

<b>Example 2:</b>

<pre><b>Input: </b>n = 5
<b>Output: </b>6
<b>Explanation</b>: The distinct numbers you can have 
are just 1 and 5 and their sum is equal to 6.
</pre>

<br>
<b>Your Task:  </b><br>
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function <b>maxSumLCM() </b>which takes n as input parameter and returns the maximum sum of distinct numbers such that the LCM of all these numbers is equal to n.<br>
<br>
<b>Expected Time Complexity:</b> O(sqrt(n))<br>
<b>Expected Auxiliary Space:</b> O(1)<br>
<br>
<b>Constraints:</b><br>
1<= N <=1000000000
