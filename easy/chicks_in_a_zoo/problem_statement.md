## Problem Statement

Initially, the zoo have a single chick. A chick gives birth to 2 chicks every day and the life expectancy of a chick is 6 days. Zoo officials want to buy food for chicks so they want to know the number of chicks on an N<sup>th</sup> day. Help the officials with this task.<br> 

<b>Example 1:</b>

<pre><b>Input: </b>N = 2 
<b>Output: </b>3
<b>Explanation: </b>First day there is only 1 chick.
On second day total number of chicks = 3.<b> </b>
</pre>

<b>Example 2:</b>

<pre><b>Input: </b>N = 3
<b>Output: </b>9
<b>Explanation: </b>First day there is only 1 chick.
On second day total number of chicks = 3.
On third day total number of chicks = 9
</pre>

 

<b>Your Task:</b><br>You don't need to read or print anything, Your task is to complete the function <b>NoOfChicks() </b>which takes N as the input parameter and returns the total no. of chicks on the N<sup>th</sup> day.<br> 

<b>Expected Time Complexity: </b>O(N)<br><b>Expected Space Complexity: </b>O(N)<br> 

<b>Constraints:</b><br>1 <= N <= 35
