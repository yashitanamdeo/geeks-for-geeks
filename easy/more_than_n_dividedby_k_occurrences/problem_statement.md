## Problem Statement

Given an array <b>arr</b>Â and an element <b>k</b>. The task is to find the count of elements in the array that appear more than <b>n/k</b> times and n is length of arr.

<b>Examples :</b>

<pre><b>Input: </b>arr = [3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3], k = 4
<b>Output: </b>2<b>
Explanation: </b>In the given array, 3 and 2 are the only elements that appears more than n/k times.
</pre>

<pre><b>Input: </b>arr = [2, 3, 3, 2], k = 3
<b>Output: </b>2<b>
Explanation: </b>In the given array, 3 and 2 are the only elements that appears more than n/k times. So the count of elements are 2.<br></pre>

<pre><b>Input: </b>arr = [1, 4, 7, 7], k = 2
<b>Output: </b>0<b>
Explanation: </b>In the given array, no element appears more than n/k times.</pre>

<b>Constraints:</b><br>1 <= arr.size() <= 10<sup>6</sup><br>0 <= arr[i] <= 10<sup>8</sup><br>1 <= k <= arr.size()

## Expected Complexities
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Auxiliary Space: O(n)
